        "\n",
        "• The Logic: By setting `stride = kernel_size`, we force the filter to jump exactly the width of one patch after processing it. This ensures no overlap between patches.\n",

        "\n",
        "  • Image Size: 16x16 pixels.\n",
        "\n",
        "  • Kernel Size: 4 (This defines the patch size as 4x4).\n",

        "\n",
        "• The Filter Shape: Since your patch is 4x4 with 3 color channels (RGB), every single filter has the shape 4x4x3.\n",
        "\n",
        "How the Embedding is built for ONE patch:\n",
        "\n",
        "• Filter 1: A block of weights (4x4x3). It overlays the patch, multiplies all the pixel values by its weights, sums them up, and produces 1 single number.\n",
        "\n",
        "• Filter 2: A different block of weights (4x4x3). It looks at the same patch and produces a 2nd number.\n",
        "\n",
        "• ... (repeating this process) ...\n",
        "\n",
        "• Filter 64: It looks at the patch and produces the 64th number.\n",
        "\n",
